# Nursery Management Service

This service enables daycare centers to efficiently manage children, parents, and communications with them. It also allows for the addition of activities, diaper changes, and naps throughout the day, along with their respective quality assessments.

### Key Features:

- **Child and Parent Management**: Easily manage the information of children and their parents.
- **Activity Tracking**: Add and monitor daily activities, diaper changes, and nap times, including their quality.
- **IRP (Individualized Reception Project)**: Some children have an IRP, which is highlighted for daycare staff to prevent mistakes and ensure proper care.
- **Treatment Management**: For children undergoing one or more treatments, this service prominently displays the necessary information to daycare staff, ensuring proper administration.
- **Parental Notifications**: Parents receive notifications when actions, such as activities or treatments, have been completed. If an activity is logged, photos can be attached for parents to view.
- **Chat Service**: A chat feature is available for communication between parents and daycare staff. This allows staff to request information during the day and for parents to notify staff of important details regarding their child.
- **Manager Mode**: The manager can add children and parents during the contract signing process. They can also add IRPs, treatments with dosages if needed, and predefined activities that staff can assign to children throughout the day.
- **Inventory Management**: The system includes a stock management feature that alerts staff and managers to shortages or expirations. This can serve as a compliance measure for child protection services.
