Feature:
    In order to display children with an IRP
    As an API consumer
    I want to have access to related IRP child data

    Background:
        Given there is a nursery structure with uuid "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001"
        And a manager exists with user "manager@example.com" and password "password123"
        And I am authenticated as "manager@example.com" with password "password123"

    Scenario: I can create a child with an IRP
        Given there is a child with uuid "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001"
        And that child has firstname Quentin
        And that child has lastname Lemoine
        And that child has a birthday on "1993-06-17"
        And that child has a created date "2024-10-11 00:00:00"
        And that child has an updated date "2024-10-11 12:00:00"
        And there is an IRP with name "Allergie aux arachides"
        And that IRP has description "Ne pas donner de plat contenant de l'arachide"
        And that IRP has a created date "2024-10-10 00:00:00"
        And that IRP has a start date "2024-01-01 00:00:00"
        And that IRP has an end date "2025-01-01 00:00:00"
        And that child is linked to IPR with name "Allergie aux arachides"
        When I request "/api/children/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001"
        Then the response code is 200
        And the response body contains JSON:
